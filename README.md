   - âœ… Selecting *Fruits* checks all individual fruits.  
   - âœ… Selecting *Vegetables* checks all individual vegetables.  
   - âœ… Parent checkboxes correctly display checked / indeterminate states depending on children.  
3. *Loom Video* â€“ A walkthrough of the code and demo of functionality.
